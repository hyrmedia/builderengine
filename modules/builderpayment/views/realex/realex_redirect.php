<!--
https://hpp.realexpayments.com/pay is the script where the hidden fields
for LIVE transactions are POSTed to.

If the merchant is in TEST mode, the script to post the hidden fields to is:
https://hpp.sandbox.realexpayments.com/pay

The values are sent to Realex Payments via hidden fields in a HTML form POST.
Please look at the documentation to show all the possible hidden fields you
can send to Realex Payments.

Note: 
The more data you send to Realex Payments the more details will be available
on our reporting tool, Real Control, for the merchant to view and pull reports 
down from.

Note:
If you POST data in hidden fields that are not a Realex hidden field that data 
will be POSTed back directly to your response script. This way you can maintain
data even when you are redirected away from your site
